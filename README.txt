In this repository, you can find all the code used to generate and analyse the results shown in the paper "The role of Ekman currents, geostrophy and Stokes drift in the accumulation of floating microplastic". The layout is as follows:
Data Sets: Code used to download the GlobCurrent & WaveWatch III datasets, compute daily mean fields for the Stokes drift and Wind, along with code to generate the artificial boundary current field used to prevent particle beaching
Figures: Contains code to generate the figures that show results from both the Atlantic and Pacific basins.
Global: Contains code used to carry out the global Lagrangian simulations and analyse the results.
North Atlantic: Contains code used to carry out the North Atlantic Lagrangian simulations and analyse the results.
North Pacific: Contains code used to carry out the North Pacific Lagrangian simulations and analyse the results.
